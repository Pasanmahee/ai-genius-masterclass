# Creating AI Music with Ava: A User’s Guide to Composing Original Tracks

Music composition can be a complex and time-consuming process, but with advances in AI technology, tools like Ava AI are making it easier than ever to create original music. Ava AI allows users to generate compositions across a wide range of genres with just a few clicks. Let's dive into how you can start creating your own music using Ava.

## Getting Started with Ava AI

First, visit the Ava AI homepage at [Ava AI's website](https://www.aiva.ai/). Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating your first track:

### Step 1: Create a Composition

Navigate to the ‘Create Composition’ section to begin. You'll be presented with an array of musical genres to choose from, ensuring that whatever your musical taste, Ava has something for you.

### Step 2: Selecting the Genre

For our example, we’ll create a track in the 'Friend's House' genre. This selection will influence the overall style and feel of the music Ava produces.

### Step 3: Configuring Your Track

You can customize your composition by selecting:
- **Number of Compositions:** Decide how many different tracks Ava should generate.
- **Key Signature:** Choose 'Auto' for Ava to automatically select, or specify if you want a major (often perceived as happy) or minor (often perceived as sad) key.
- **Duration:** Set the length of your track.

### Step 4: Listening to Your Music

After hitting 'Create', Ava will process your inputs and generate the compositions. You can then listen to each track and decide which one best suits your needs.

## Exploring Further

Ava isn’t limited to one style. After creating your initial track, you can return to the home page and experiment with other genres like solo piano or fantasy wave. This versatility allows you to either use Ava as an alternative to traditional music libraries or as a tool for creating entirely original compositions.
