## Reviewing and Downloading Your Video

Once the video is generated, Dash ID allows you to review the final product:

- **Play the Video**: Watch the animated avatar to ensure the synchronization and animation meet your expectations.
- **Editing Options**: If necessary, make adjustments to improve the syncing or modify the avatar’s expressions.
- **Download or Share**: You can download the final video for use in your projects or share it directly online.
