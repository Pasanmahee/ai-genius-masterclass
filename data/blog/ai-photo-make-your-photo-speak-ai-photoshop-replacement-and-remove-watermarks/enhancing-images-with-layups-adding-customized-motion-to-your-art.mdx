# Enhancing Images with Layups: Adding Customized Motion to Your Art

In today's digital age, static images can sometimes feel a bit flat. But what if you could add a layer of motion to them, bringing them to life? That's exactly what the AI tool Layups allows you to do. This guide will walk you through how to use Layups to add dynamic motion to your images, enhancing their appeal and engagement.

## Uploading Your Image

First, head over to [Layups](https://convert.leiapix.com/), an innovative tool that breathes life into static images by adding 3D movement. Start by uploading a photo. For this demonstration, we’ll use an image generated on [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). Simply hit the 'Upload' button and select your image.

## Customizing the Animation

Once your image is uploaded, Layups immediately starts to add some impressive 3D movement. Here’s how you can fine-tune the motion to suit your vision:

- **Adjusting Animation Length:** Control how quickly the image moves to match the mood you want to convey.
- **Changing Animation Style:** Select the direction of the camera’s movement to highlight different aspects of the image.
- **Modifying Motion Intensity:** Increase or decrease the amount of motion to get just the right effect.
- **Setting the Focal Point:** Choose from options like 'close', 'center', and 'far' to change the depth of the movement.

## Understanding the Depth Map

Click on the 'Depth Map' to view the cutout used by Layups to differentiate foreground from background. This feature is crucial as it determines how the motion is applied. You can adjust these parameters to refine the movement and achieve a cleaner, more coherent animation.

## Exporting Your Animated Image

After customizing your image, it’s time to share your creation. Layups provides various export options:

- **Download Formats:** Save your animated image as a GIF or an MP4, among other formats.
- **Sharing to Social Media:** Directly share your animated art to social platforms to engage your audience.

Let's save this image as a GIF in full size. Just click 'Save', and your image will be exported as an automatically looping GIF file, perfect for online display.

## Conclusion

Layups offers a unique way to enhance images from Midjourney and other sources by adding customizable motion. Whether it’s portraits, landscapes, or any other type of photo, Layups can elevate your digital artwork with engaging, dynamic effects.

Embrace the power of AI and transform your static images into captivating, animated pieces with Layups.
