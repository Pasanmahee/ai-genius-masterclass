# Exploring Runway Gen One on Discord: A Comprehensive Guide

The introduction of Runway Gen One has brought a new era of video editing capabilities directly to Discord. This innovative integration allows users to access advanced AI tools within a familiar platform. Here's a first look at how Gen One enhances the video editing process on Discord.

## Getting Started with Runway Gen One

### Access and Layout

Once you gain access to Runway Gen One, a new tab labeled 'Gen One' appears in your Discord interface. This tab unlocks a plethora of new options for video creation and editing, transforming your Discord into a powerful video editing suite.

### Navigating the Interface

- **Welcome Instructors Tab:** This is your starting point where you can watch a tutorial video explaining the functionalities of Gen One, how to use it, and where to post your videos.
- **Generate Channels:** Here, youâ€™ll find channels like Generate One, Two, and Three, which are dedicated spaces for your video projects to reside.

## Interactive Video Editing

### Collaborative Environment

Runway Gen One on Discord is not just about editing videos; it's about community and collaboration. As you navigate through the Generate channels:

- **View Projects:** You can scroll through and view videos created by other users, gaining inspiration and understanding different creative approaches.
- **Participate in Threads:** Each project has its own thread where you can see the progression of a video from the original source to the final edited version. This feature allows for ongoing iterations within the same thread, enabling continuous improvement and variation.

### Example of Collaboration

For instance, a user might start with a video of themselves playing with a yo-yo, accompanied by a desired reference image. As you click into their thread, you can observe how Gen One has applied the visual qualities of the image to the video. Users can experiment with different videos or images in the same thread, which keeps all related content neatly organized.

### Download and Apply References

An exciting feature of Gen One on Discord is the ability to download reference images used by others. If a certain combination catches your eye, like a striking mermaid theme, you can download that image and apply it to your own video, fostering a rich environment of shared resources and creativity.

## Conclusion

Runway Gen One's integration with Discord represents a significant leap forward in making sophisticated video editing tools accessible within a community-driven platform. As we continue to explore Gen One, future lessons will delve deeper into the creation process, helping you to fully leverage this powerful tool to transform your video projects.
