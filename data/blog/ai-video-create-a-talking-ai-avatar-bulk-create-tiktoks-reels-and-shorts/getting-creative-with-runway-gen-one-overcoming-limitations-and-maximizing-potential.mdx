# Getting Creative with Runway Gen One: Overcoming Limitations and Maximizing Potential

Runway Gen One is transforming the landscape of video production with its advanced AI capabilities. However, like any tool, it comes with its own set of limitations and learning curves. In this post, we'll explore how to effectively use Gen One, despite its constraints, to create captivating video content.

## Understanding the Limitations

### Video Length and File Size

Currently, Gen One allows you to produce videos up to three seconds long. While this may seem restrictive, it opens up a world of creativity when you consider stringing together multiple clips for a longer project. Here’s how to manage:

- **Regular Discord App:** You're limited to an 8MB file size, which is generally sufficient for a three-second clip filmed on an iPhone.
- **Discord Nitro:** The file size limit increases to 100MB, offering more flexibility for higher quality or more complex shots.

## The Creation Process

### Step 1: Filming

Grab your iPhone and set it to cinematic mode. For our example, we'll use a simple subject—a turtle—and perform basic camera movements to capture the footage. Remember, Gen One does not process sound, so any audio will need to be added post-editing.

### Step 2: Uploading and Adding References

Once your clip is ready:
- Upload it to Gen One via the Discord app.
- Add a reference image to guide the AI in styling your video.

### Step 3: Generating Content

Navigate to your thread in Gen One and start the transformation process. Add your video and reference image, then watch as Gen One applies the image’s style to your video. You can create multiple threads to experiment with different styles or continue iterating within the same thread.

## Observing the Results

Gen One intelligently distinguishes between the subject and background. For instance, it might turn the turtle into a grassy island or set it amidst cotton candy clouds based on the reference image used. The interaction between your video’s content and the chosen image dramatically affects the outcome.

### Iteration and Refinement

Experiment with various reference images to see which one best suits your vision. Consistency across multiple clips is key if you're aiming to compile them into a longer video. This approach ensures a uniform look and feel throughout your project.

## Conclusion

Despite its limitations, Runway Gen One offers unprecedented creative possibilities in video editing. By understanding and adapting to its constraints, you can unlock a new realm of visual storytelling. Whether you're a professional filmmaker or a hobbyist, Gen One equips you with the tools to create visually stunning, AI-enhanced videos.

Embrace the challenge, and let Gen One transform your creative vision into reality!
