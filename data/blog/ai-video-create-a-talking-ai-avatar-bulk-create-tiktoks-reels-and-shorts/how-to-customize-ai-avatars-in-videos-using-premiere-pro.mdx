# How to Customize AI Avatars in Videos Using Premiere Pro

Creating engaging and visually appealing videos for platforms like TikTok can be significantly simplified using AI avatars from Synthesia. Adding a personal touch with Adobe Premiere Pro enhances these videos even further. Here's a fun walkthrough on how to do it, inspired by a recent viral video.

## Using Synthesia for AI Avatars

### Step 1: Write Your Script

Start by writing a script for your video. Tools like ChatGPT or Jasper can help craft compelling dialogue. Once your script is ready, paste it into Synthesia.

### Step 2: Choose Your Avatar

Synthesia offers a variety of avatars, such as Rosie or Audrey. Select one that best fits the style and tone of your video.

### Step 3: Customize Pronunciation

If the AI mispronounces any words, simply highlight the word, click 'Diction,' and type in the correct pronunciation to ensure your avatar speaks clearly.

### Step 4: Opt for a Green Screen Background

Selecting a green screen background in Synthesia is crucial if you plan to customize the background later in Premiere Pro.

## Editing in Adobe Premiere Pro

Once you've generated your video with an AI avatar on a green screen, it’s time to bring it into Adobe Premiere Pro for further editing.

### Step 1: Add Your Video to the Timeline

Drag your video onto the Premiere Pro timeline.

### Step 2: Apply the Ultra Key Effect

Navigate to the effects panel, search for "Ultra Key," and drag this effect onto your clip.

### Step 3: Remove the Green Screen

In the effect controls, use the color dropper to select the green color behind your avatar. This will remove the green screen, allowing you to add any background you desire.

## Alternatives If You Don't Have Premiere Pro

If you don’t have access to Premiere Pro, Synthesia offers tools to change the background directly within the platform, providing a straightforward alternative for customizing your videos.

## Conclusion

AI avatars are a powerful tool for creating dynamic and engaging content for social media. By combining Synthesia’s AI capabilities with the advanced editing features of Premiere Pro, you can produce high-quality videos that stand out. Whether you're aiming to increase your TikTok views or enhance your video content across other platforms, these tools offer a range of possibilities to explore and expand your digital creativity.
