# Understanding and Utilizing Gen One Parameters for Enhanced Video Editing

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Runway Gen One, a revolutionary AI tool that's changing the landscape of video editing. This post is designed to help you understand and utilize Gen One's parameters effectively to enhance your video projects.

## Getting Started with Gen One

### Initial Setup

Runway Gen One operates within Discord, making it accessible and easy to integrate into your workflow. Hereâ€™s what you need to know to get started:

- **Input Requirements:** Your input video should be under 8MB for standard Discord users or up to 100MB for Discord Nitro users.
- **Video Length:** Gen One processes videos in 95-frame chunks, approximately three seconds long.
- **Preparation:** Trim your video to the desired segment before uploading if the specific part you want to use is in the middle of a longer clip.

## Using Gen One on Discord

To use Gen One:

1. **Upload Your Video:** Add Gen One in a Discord channel, then upload your video and either a reference image or a text prompt.
2. **Initiate Processing:** After you click send, Gen One will open a video queue ticket as a thread on Discord, showing the parameters being used.

## Advanced Parameter Adjustments

Gen One offers a range of parameters that you can tweak to customize the AI's output:

- **Depth Blur Level:** Controls how closely the output adheres to the input. Scale from 0 (very close) to 7 (loose interpretation).
- **CFG Temporal Scale:** Manages temporal consistency. Recommended values are between 1 and 1.25 for optimal balance.
- **CFG Scale:** Determines how strongly the AI considers your text or image prompt. Settings between 7.5 and 12.5 strike a good balance between creativity and adherence to the prompt.
- **Seed Value:** Allows for replication of results by specifying a seed number.
- **Upscale:** Enhances the resolution of the output video.
- **Compare and Interpolate:** Tools for comparing the original and generated videos and smoothing frame transitions.

### Special Modes for Targeted Effects:

- **Green Screen:** Isolates the subject and replaces the background with a chroma key green.
- **Mask Modes:** Choose to affect only the foreground or the background, leaving the other untouched.

## Practical Tips for Using Gen One

Here are some tips to make the most out of Gen One:

- **Experiment with Parameters:** Each project might need different settings, so don't hesitate to experiment.
- **Use the Compare Feature:** It's a great way to see side-by-side how the changes you make affect the output.
- **Iterate for Perfection:** If you're not satisfied with the first result, tweak the parameters and try again.

## Conclusion

Runway Gen One opens up vast creative possibilities, allowing users to push the boundaries of traditional video editing. By understanding and manipulating its parameters, you can significantly enhance the quality and creativity of your video projects. Whether you're a seasoned editor or just starting out, Gen One equips you with the tools to create visually stunning, AI-enhanced videos.
