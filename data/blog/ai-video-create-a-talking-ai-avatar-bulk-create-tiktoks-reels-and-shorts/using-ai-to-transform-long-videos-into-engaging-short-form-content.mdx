# Using AI to Transform Long Videos into Engaging Short-Form Content

Creating engaging short-form content from longer videos can be a daunting task, especially for social media platforms where quick, captivating content is king. Vidyo.ai is an AI-powered tool that simplifies this process, making it accessible to anyone looking to enhance their social media presence.

## Getting Started with Vidyo.ai

[Vidyo.ai](https://vidyo.ai/) offers a straightforward way to turn lengthy videos into snippets ideal for social media engagement. Here’s how to get started:

### Step 1: Import Your Video

Begin by either uploading a video directly from your computer or using a URL link from a platform like YouTube. For this tutorial, we will use a 16-minute tutorial video on lighting, framing, and shooting an interview.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Preferences

After pasting the video URL, click 'Start import'. For content destined for Instagram Reels or TikTok, select the 9 by 16 vertical aspect ratio to ensure your videos are optimized for these platforms.

### Step 3: Choose Templates

Scroll through the available templates and select ones that best suit your content’s style and needs. Choose multiple templates to see different styling options and decide on the best look for your clips.

## Editing and Customizing

After importing and setting up your initial preferences, Vidyo.ai uses AI to intelligently cut your long video into manageable, short clips.

### Step 4: Review and Customize Clips

Watch the generated clips and choose the framing—whether square, horizontal, or vertical—that best suits your needs. Vidyo.ai allows real-time template switching, giving you the flexibility to change the visual style as needed.

### Step 5: Final Edits

Enhance your video further by adjusting captions, adding effects, or fine-tuning other elements. Make sure everything from the audio to the visual details aligns with your brand and message.

### Step 6: Download and Share

Once satisfied with your edits and the overall look of your clips, download the videos. They are now ready to be uploaded to your chosen social media platforms, be it Instagram, TikTok, or others.
