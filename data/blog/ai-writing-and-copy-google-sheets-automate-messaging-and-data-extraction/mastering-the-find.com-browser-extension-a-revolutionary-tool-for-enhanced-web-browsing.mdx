## Installing the Find.com Browser Extension

- Search for "Find.com" using the store’s search function.

### Step 2: Adding the Extension

- You may also want to enable it in Incognito mode, depending on your browsing preferences.

## Utilizing Find.com for Enhanced Searching

### Understanding the Interface

- Find.com alters the traditional search process by integrating directly with your browser’s functionality.
- Instead of using the standard search bar, input your queries directly into Find.com’s search interface to utilize its AI capabilities.

### Example Use Case: Technical Query

Imagine you need to create code for hosting one-on-one video meetings on your website:
- Input your question into Find.com: “How do I create code that allows my website to host one-on-one video meetings?”
- Find.com processes this query, utilizing AI to provide detailed, step-by-step coding instructions and even suggesting API integrations or SDKs you might use.

### Real-Time Information and Code Examples
