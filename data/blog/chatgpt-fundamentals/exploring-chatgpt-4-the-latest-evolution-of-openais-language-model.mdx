This release includes several groundbreaking features that enhance the model's reasoning abilities, creativity, and user interaction. Here’s what you need to know about the newest model and how it differs from its predecessors.

## Enhanced Performance and Functionality

### Accessing ChatGPT-4

ChatGPT-4 is currently available to users with a Plus subscription, which costs $20 per month. Subscribers can access the new model through a dropdown menu in the ChatGPT interface, which also allows users to compare different models based on speed, reasoning, and conciseness.

### Key Upgrades in ChatGPT-4

1. **Advanced Reasoning Abilities**:
   - ChatGPT-4 can handle complex instructions and provide responses with significantly improved reasoning. Whether it’s solving intricate problems or following detailed instructions, the new model offers superior performance.

3. **Multimodal Functionality**:
   - One of the most exciting introductions in ChatGPT-4 is its multimodal capability. Although still in testing, this feature allows the model to understand and process visual inputs alongside textual queries. For example, users can upload a photo of ingredients and ask for recipe suggestions, which ChatGPT-4 can generate based on the visual and textual context.
