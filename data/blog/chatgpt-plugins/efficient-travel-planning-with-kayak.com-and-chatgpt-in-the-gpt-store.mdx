# Efficient Travel Planning with Kayak.com and ChatGPT in the GPT Store

Planning a trip can be a daunting task, involving numerous searches for flights, hotels, and car rentals. With the integration of Kayak.com in the GPT Store, coupled with the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT, travelers can now streamline this process significantly.

## Step 2: Setting Your Travel Parameters

Define the specifics of your trip to tailor your search:
- Determine your departure and destination cities, travel dates, and number of travelers.
- Consider any preferences such as flight times, hotel ratings, or rental car requirements.

## Step 3: Initiating Your Search with ChatGPT

### Finding Flights
- Ask ChatGPT to use Kayak.com to find flights that match your criteria. For example, "Find affordable flights from Los Angeles to Miami between July and October."

## Step 4: Refining Your Choices

Use ChatGPT to narrow down your options based on further preferences or new information:
- If initial results are too broad, specify additional details like "only direct flights" or "hotels near downtown."
