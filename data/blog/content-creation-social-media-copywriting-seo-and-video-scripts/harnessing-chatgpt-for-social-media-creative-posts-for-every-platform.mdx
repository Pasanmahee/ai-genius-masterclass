"Hey everyone, it's been a hot minute since I last updated you all on my life. So here it goes: I finally managed to escape the clutches of college and am now officially a graduate. It went by faster than a pizza at a party! Speaking of parties, you know what they say about college? C's get degrees, but A's get jobs. And that’s exactly what I did..."
```

## 2. Bulk Writing Twitter Posts on Cinematography
