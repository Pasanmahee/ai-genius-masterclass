In a world where digital marketing evolves at breakneck speed, AI technologies like ChatGPT are proving to be game-changers.

The brief was simple yet specific: infuse the script with Reynolds’ signature humor, including a joke and a mild curse word, to highlight Mint Mobile’s ongoing holiday promotion.

### The ChatGPT Process

- **Prompt**: Reynolds asked ChatGPT to write a commercial that maintains his tone, injects humor, and promotes Mint Mobile’s extended holiday deal.
