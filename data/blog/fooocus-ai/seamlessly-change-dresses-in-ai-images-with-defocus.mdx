It includes tools for background removal, advanced image presets, and an integrated photo editor, making it a comprehensive solution for digital fashion adjustments.

### Whatâ€™s New in Defocus?

- **Built-in Photo Editor**: Functions similar to Photoshop, allowing detailed image manipulation without additional software.
- **Background Remover**: Easily removes backgrounds, which is particularly useful when preparing images for dress changes.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster processing speeds and reduced GPU usage compared to the original Focus AI.

## How to Change Dresses with Defocus

### Step 1: Setting Up Defocus

- **Access Defocus**: Follow the link in the video description to open Defocus in Google Colab.
- **Initialize the Interface**: Execute the code to launch Defocus, which will provide a faster and more user-friendly interface than its predecessor.

### Step 2: Removing Backgrounds

- **Upload the Dress Image**: Start by removing the background from the image of the dress you wish to use. This ensures that the dress can be seamlessly integrated into the new image.

### Step 3: Dress Integration

- **Upload Your Model Image**: Import an image of your AI influencer or model to which you want to apply the new dress.
- **Configure Settings**: Adjust the 'Stop At' and 'Weightage' values to fine-tune how the dress is applied to the model. Typical settings are around 0.85 for 'Stop At' and 0.96-0.97 for 'Weightage'.

Example Prompt:
```plaintext
"Beautiful woman in a golden yellow dress"
```

### Step 4: Advanced Editing
- **Use Inpainting Tools:** If necessary, use the inpainting feature to correct any mismatches or errors after the dress has been applied.
- **Final Adjustments:** Utilize the built-in photo editing tools in Defocus to refine the image, adjusting colors, contrasts, or other visual elements to perfect the appearance.

## Practical Applications
- **Fashion Design:** Quickly prototype different outfits on virtual models.
