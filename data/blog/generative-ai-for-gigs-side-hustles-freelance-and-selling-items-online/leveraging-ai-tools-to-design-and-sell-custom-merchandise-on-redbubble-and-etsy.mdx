# Leveraging AI Tools to Design and Sell Custom Merchandise on Redbubble and Etsy

Creating and selling custom merchandise has never been easier, thanks to the plethora of online platforms and AI tools available to entrepreneurs and creatives. This guide will walk you through the process of designing and selling merchandise, specifically phone cases and T-shirts, using popular platforms like [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com).

## Finding Trending Designs on Redbubble

Start by visiting Redbubble and exploring the "Phone Cases" category. You can sort the products by "Trending" to see what designs are currently popular. Typically, these products sell for around $30, offering a good profit margin for a well-designed case. Here’s a [link to all phone cases](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/phone-cases) on Redbubble.

## Exploring Successful Etsy Designs

Next, head over to Etsy and look at different categories such as clothing. A good example is a T-shirt with a "Circle of Flowers" design, which boasts five-star reviews and over 13,000 purchases. This design popularity indicates a high market demand.

## Creating Designs Using AI

### Designing a Phone Case

Use an AI tool like Midjourney to create a phone case design featuring "waves and a sunset in the style of Katsushika Hokusai." Adjust the design as needed until you achieve a satisfactory result.

### Designing a T-Shirt

For the T-shirt, try creating a "circle of flowers" design. If the initial result isn’t perfect, iterate with modifications like "flowers in the shape of a circle wreath" to perfect the design.

## Preparing Your Designs with Canva

Once you have your designs, import them into [Canva](https://www.canva.com) to make final adjustments. Use tools such as the background remover to isolate your design for a T-shirt. You can also add text to customize your merchandise further. For example, adding the word "Wild" in an attractive font can enhance the appeal of a floral T-shirt design.

## Listing Your Products on Etsy

Once your design is ready, here's how to get it onto a T-shirt and listed on Etsy:
1. Create a high-quality image of your design with a transparent background, ideally in PNG format.
2. Visit a print-on-demand service, like the ones offered on Redbubble, to create a sample of your T-shirt.
3. Take professional photos of your sample for your Etsy listing.
4. Create your product listing on Etsy, setting a competitive price and a detailed description.
5. Promote your product through social media and other channels to increase visibility.

## Conclusion

By leveraging AI design tools and platforms like Redbubble and Etsy, you can create and sell custom merchandise with ease. This guide has walked you through each step of the process, from design creation to product listing. Whether you’re looking to design phone cases, T-shirts, or other merchandise, these tools and strategies can help you turn your creative ideas into profitable products.
