# Mastering Multi Prompts and Prompt Weighting in Mid Journey

In this lesson, we dive into two powerful techniques to refine how Mid Journey interprets and executes your prompts: multi prompts and prompt weighting. These methods provide greater control over the output, allowing for more detailed and specific artistic creations.

## Understanding Multi Prompts

Multi prompts help clarify how words in your prompts are interpreted by Mid Journey, particularly useful for ambiguous terms that might have multiple meanings.

### How Multi Prompts Work

- **Example**: The term "hot dog" typically represents the food item. However, if you're aiming for an image of a "hot" (overheated) "dog" (the animal), using double colons like `hot::dog` directs Mid Journey to treat them as separate concepts.
- **Cupcake Example**:
  - **Standard Prompt**: "cupcake" — Mid Journey generates images of cupcakes.
  - **Multi Prompt**: "cup::cake" — Mid Journey interprets it as a cup with a cake inside it, treating the words as separate items.

This technique is particularly useful for avoiding common misconceptions and ensuring that each element of the prompt is understood in its intended context.

## Exploring Prompt Weighting

Prompt weighting allows you to assign importance to certain aspects of your prompt, influencing the prominence of these elements in the generated image.

### How to Use Prompt Weighting

To implement prompt weighting, append a numerical value to the elements of your prompt using double colons. This value dictates the relative emphasis Mid Journey should place on each component.

- **Example**: 
  - **Basic Prompt**: "landscape with trees and a lake"
  - **Weighted Prompt**: "landscape with trees::200 and a lake::1000"
  - **Result**: The landscape image will feature the lake more prominently than the trees due to the higher weight assigned to "lake."

### Practical Application

You can use prompt weighting to manipulate the composition of your images, ensuring that certain features are more dominant or subdued, depending on your artistic goals.

## Combining Techniques for Enhanced Control

These techniques can be combined or used separately to fine-tune the output of your Mid Journey prompts. For instance, if you want a specific scene composition:

- **Foreground and Background Control**:
  - **Desired Setup**: A person in the foreground with a building in the background.
  - **Prompt**: "person in the foreground::1000 with a building in the background::200"

This prompt ensures that Mid Journey focuses more on the person while still including the building as a secondary element.

## Conclusion

Multi prompts and prompt weighting are invaluable tools for artists using Mid Journey to create AI-generated art. By mastering these techniques, you can ensure that your prompts are not only understood more accurately by the AI but also that they reflect your intended artistic vision with greater precision.

Experiment with these advanced techniques to discover new possibilities in AI art creation and refine your workflow to produce consistently better results.
