# Mastering Advanced Stylization Techniques in Mid Journey

Mid Journey provides a robust suite of advanced parameters that allow artists to exert fine control over the stylization of their AI-generated art. From adjusting creativity levels to specifying what elements to exclude, these tools offer unprecedented control over the final outputs. This guide will explore several key parameters that can transform your artistic process.

## Stylization Intensity

The stylization parameter (`--stylize`) adjusts how creatively Mid Journey interprets your prompts:

- **Low Stylization (`--stylize 50`)**: The AI adheres closely to the prompt with minimal creative interpretation, ideal for when precision is needed.
- **Default Stylization (`--stylize 100`)**: A balanced level of creativity, used by default.
- **High Stylization (`--stylize 750`)**: Increases the AI’s creative input, adding unique twists and enhancing the artistic flair of the image.

### Practical Use of Stylization

To see the effects of different stylization levels, you might test the parameter with a simple image prompt, observing how the intensity alters the artistic interpretation.

## Tileable Patterns

The tile parameter (`--tile`) is a specialized feature that creates images with seamless edges, perfect for patterns or backgrounds that need to repeat without visible seams.

- **Usage**: `--tile` is particularly useful for designing wallpapers, textiles, or any other materials where a continuous pattern is beneficial.

## Version Styles

With the introduction of version four, Mid Journey introduced style variations that slightly alter the rendition of your prompts:

- **Variants**: `--v4a`, `--v4b`, `--v4c` each produce subtly different artistic takes on the same prompt, allowing you to choose which style aligns best with your vision.

### Selecting a Style Variant

Experiment with different version styles to find the one that consistently delivers results you prefer, and consider using it regularly to maintain a consistent artistic style in your projects.

## Exclusion Parameters

The exclusion parameter (`--no`) is powerful for specifying what elements should not appear in the final image, offering precise control over the content.

- **Examples**:
  - **Exclude Colors**: `--no red` removes all red hues from the image.
  - **Exclude Objects**: `--no clouds` ensures the image will not include any clouds, perfect for clear sky landscapes.

### Implementing Exclusions

Utilizing the `--no` parameter can refine your artistic outputs by preventing unwanted elements from appearing, enhancing the relevance and clarity of your artwork.

## Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing the advanced stylization parameters in Mid Journey can significantly enhance your ability to create tailored and distinctive AI art. These tools not only allow for greater artistic freedom but also ensure that your artworks align precisely with your creative vision.

Embrace these advanced techniques to push the boundaries of AI art creation, and continue exploring Mid Journey’s capabilities to further refine your skills and develop your unique artistic style.
