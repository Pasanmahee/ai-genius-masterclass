# Capturing the Creative Process: Generating Videos in Mid Journey

One of the unique features of Mid Journey is its ability to generate a video showing the detailed process of how your AI artwork is created. This functionality not only adds a layer of transparency to the AI's operations but also provides a visually appealing way to engage audiences with the art creation process. This guide will walk you through how to generate these videos and the adjustments needed if you are using the latest versions of Mid Journey.

## Introduction to Process Videos

Process videos in Mid Journey offer a dynamic view into the AI’s decision-making and artistic development, capturing each iteration from the initial abstract forms to the final detailed image. This can be particularly insightful and engaging for presentations, educational content, or social media sharing.

## How to Generate Process Videos

To create a process video of your artwork being generated, you will need to add the `--video` parameter to your prompt. Here's how to integrate this feature:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Compose Your Prompt:**
   Start by writing a prompt as you normally would. For instance:

   ```plaintext
   heroic looking lion in the African desert, harsh sunlight, warm tones, photo hyper-realistic, and inspiring
   ```

2. **Add the Video Parameter:**
   Append --video at the end of your prompt to instruct Mid Journey to record the creation process:

   ```plaintext
   heroic looking lion in the African desert, harsh sunlight, warm tones, photo hyper-realistic, and inspiring --video
   ```

3. **Version Compatibility:**
   If you are using version four of Mid Journey, note that --video may not be supported. In such cases, you can switch to an earlier version that supports video generation, like version three:

   ```plaintext
   --version 3
   ```

4. **Generating the Video:**
   After submitting the prompt, Mid Journey will generate the initial images and record the process. Once complete, react to the prompt with the mail emoji in Discord to receive a link to the video.

### Viewing the Video

The video link provided by Mid Journey will direct you to a page where you can watch the step-by-step evolution of your artwork. This can be a fascinating insight into the AI's creative process and a great tool for understanding more about AI art generation.

## Practical Applications

Process videos are particularly useful for artists, educators, and content creators who wish to:

- **Showcase the AI’s Creative Process:** Share how the AI transforms basic prompts into complex images.
- **Educational Purposes:** Teach about AI art generation techniques and decision-making.
- **Marketing and Engagement:** Use the videos to engage viewers on social media or in art exhibitions.

## Conclusion

Creating process videos in Mid Journey is a powerful way to visually document and share the journey of your AI-generated art from concept to completion. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can add an exciting multimedia dimension to your AI art projects, offering viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the artistry of AI.

Embrace this feature to enhance your presentations, educational material, or social media content, bringing your audience closer to the intricate process of AI-driven art creation.
