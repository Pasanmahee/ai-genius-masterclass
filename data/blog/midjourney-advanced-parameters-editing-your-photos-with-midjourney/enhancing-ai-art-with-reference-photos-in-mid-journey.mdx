# Using Reference Photos to Guide AI Art Creation in Mid Journey

Integrating reference photos into your AI art creation process can significantly enhance the detail and relevance of your outputs. Mid Journey's new feature allows users to upload and use their own photos as starting points for generating artworks. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using reference photos in Mid Journey to achieve more personalized and contextually rich results.

## Getting Started with Reference Photos

Using reference photos in Mid Journey involves uploading an image directly into the Discord interface and incorporating it into your art generation prompts. This method ensures that the AI uses the visual cues from your photo to influence the final artwork.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Reference Photos

1. **Upload Your Photo**:

   - Click the plus icon next to the message box in Discord to upload your photo.
   - You can upload multiple photos as needed for your project.

2. **Initiate Your Prompt**:

   - After uploading, drag the photo into the prompt box, which automatically inserts a URL link to the image in Discord.
   - Alternatively, use a direct URL link to a photo found online by pasting it into your prompt.

3. **Compose Your Artistic Prompt**:

   - Following the photo link, write your artistic prompt to guide the AI further. For example:
     ```plaintext
     futuristic multi-colored vibrance on the moon
     ```
   - This tells Mid Journey to transform the reference image with specified artistic elements.

4. **Generate the Artwork**:
   - Press Enter to start generating the artwork based on your reference photo and additional descriptive elements.

### Example Scenarios

- **Transforming Daylight Photos**:
  - Upload a daylight photo and modify it with studio lighting effects or place it in a different setting like snow or a bioluminescent environment.
- **Creative Enhancements**:
  - Take a straightforward image of an object and reimagine it with vibrant colors or fantastical elements, demonstrating Mid Journey's capacity to creatively transform reference materials.

## Tips for Successful Reference Photo Usage

- **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images for better details in the final AI artwork.
- **Subject Clarity**: Choose images with clear subjects to ensure the AI correctly identifies and enhances them.
- **Experimentation**: Don't hesitate to experiment with different settings and prompts to see how various changes affect the artwork.

## Conclusion

Reference photos are a powerful tool in Mid Journey, allowing for a deeper level of personalization and creativity in your AI-generated art. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly integrate your own photos into the AI art creation process, resulting in unique and meaningful artworks that resonate more closely with your creative vision.
