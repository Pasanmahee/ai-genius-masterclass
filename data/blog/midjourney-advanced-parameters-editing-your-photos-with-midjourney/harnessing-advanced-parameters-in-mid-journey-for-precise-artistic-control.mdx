# Mastering Advanced Parameters in Mid Journey

Enhancing your AI art involves more than just generating images; it requires precise control over the generation process. Mid Journey offers several advanced parameters that allow artists to fine-tune their outputs for more consistent and targeted results. This guide will explore key parameters like chaos, quality, and seed, and how to apply them to your prompts.

## Understanding Chaos

The chaos parameter (`--c`) influences the variety within your initial image grid. By adjusting this parameter, you can dictate how cohesive or varied the generated images are.

- **Low Chaos (`--c 10`)**: Produces images that are similar in style and theme, ideal for when you have a clear vision of the desired outcome.
- **High Chaos (`--c 50`)**: Generates a wide range of variations, useful when exploring creative possibilities or when unsure of the specific style you want.

## Quality Settings

The quality parameter (`--q`) adjusts the resolution and detail level of your images, affecting both the output quality and the generation speed.

- **Low Quality (`--q 0.25`)**: Fastest generation with reduced detail, suitable for quick iterations.
- **Medium Quality (`--q 0.5`)**: Balances speed and detail, offering a decent visualization without long wait times.
- **High Quality (`--q 1`)**: Default setting, providing the best balance of detail and generation time.
- **Highest Quality (`--q 2`)**: Available in previous versions (up to V3), this setting offers the highest detail at the expense of longer generation times and higher resource use.

## Seed Control

The seed parameter (`--seed`) is a powerful tool for achieving consistency in style across different prompts. It sets a numerical value that dictates the randomness of image generation, allowing you to reproduce similar styles or variations by reusing the seed number.

- **Usage**: If you find a particular style you like, you can extract the seed number using the envelope emoji in Discord and apply it to new prompts to maintain stylistic consistency.

### Practical Example: Using Seed to Standardize Outputs

- **Prompt**: "Owl pitcher in three styles --seed 123"
- **Outcome**: Using the same seed with different prompts ensures that all generated images share a similar aesthetic foundation, making them part of a cohesive series.

## Implementing Advanced Parameters

Hereâ€™s how to integrate these parameters into a typical Mid Journey workflow:

```plaintext
"Woodcut birch forest --q 0.5 --c 20 --seed 98765"
```

This prompt sets medium quality and moderate chaos with a specific seed to ensure that the forest is depicted with consistent artistic traits across multiple generations.

## Conclusion

Advanced parameters in Mid Journey are essential tools for artists seeking to refine their AI-generated art. By understanding and manipulating chaos, quality, and seed settings, you can produce artworks that not only meet your aesthetic criteria but also remain consistent across different projects.

Experiment with these parameters to discover new artistic possibilities and gain greater control over your creative process, ensuring each piece of art is exactly as you envision.
