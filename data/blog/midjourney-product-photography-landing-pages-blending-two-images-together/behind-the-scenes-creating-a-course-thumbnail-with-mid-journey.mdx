# Creating a Dynamic Course Thumbnail Using Mid Journey: A Detailed Case Study

In this tutorial, we dive deep into the creative process of designing a course thumbnail using Mid Journey. This case study not only highlights the capabilities of AI in digital art creation but also offers practical insights into the iterative design process.

## Conceptualization

The initial concept for our course thumbnail was to create an image featuring two individuals in superhero or astronaut attire instead of everyday clothes, aiming for an eye-catching and thematic visual.

### Initial Experiments

- **Starting Point**: The process began by experimenting with a base photo of an individual named Benza, applying various themes like "Marvel character" to see how Mid Journey would transform the image.
- **Challenges**: Early attempts led to overly stylized transformations that deviated too much from Benza's original appearance, prompting further adjustments and experimentation with different themes and settings.

### Refining the Idea

After several iterations that did not meet our expectations:
- **Focus Shift**: The focus shifted from transforming the entire image to adjusting the background to better highlight the subject.
- **Background Experimentation**: Various prompts were tested to generate interesting backgrounds that could complement the subject without overshadowing it.

## Breakthroughs and Adjustments

- **Simplification**: A breakthrough occurred when the background was removed from the base images, simplifying the input for Mid Journey and leading to more controlled and desirable outputs.
- **Outfit Customization**: The focus then moved to customizing outfits. By simplifying the input images (e.g., plain-colored shirts without logos), Mid Journey was able to generate more suitable superhero costumes.

### Finalizing the Image

- **Selecting the Best Outputs**: Numerous generated images were reviewed, and the best ones were selected based on outfit details, lighting, and overall appeal.
- **Photo Editing**: Final edits involved Photoshop to fine-tune and combine elements from Mid Journey with high-resolution photos of the individuals.

## Technical Insights

- **Pose Considerations**: It was noted that the pose of the subjects in the photos could significantly affect the output. Static poses without complex background elements yielded the best results.
- **Background Challenges**: Attempts to introduce complex backgrounds like hangars with spaceships were eventually abandoned in favor of simpler, more focused backgrounds.

## The Final Product

The completed thumbnail features both subjects in heroic outfits, directly engaging the viewer, achieved through a combination of Mid Journey's AI capabilities and skilled photo editing.

### Conclusion

This case study not only showcases the potential of AI tools like Mid Journey in creating promotional artwork but also emphasizes the importance of iteration, simplification, and creative problem-solving in digital design. The final product effectively conveys the course's dynamic and innovative nature, appealing to prospective students.

By understanding the tools and processes involved, designers can leverage AI to enhance their creative projects, making complex artwork more accessible and customizable.
