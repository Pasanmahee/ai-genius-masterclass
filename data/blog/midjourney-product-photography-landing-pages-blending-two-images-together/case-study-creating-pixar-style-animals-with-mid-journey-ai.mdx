# Rapid Creation of Pixar-Style Animals with Mid Journey: A Case Study

Creating a diverse array of Pixar-style animal characters can be a daunting task, especially when aiming for consistency in style, framing, and lighting. However, by integrating Mid Journey with other AI tools, this process can be greatly expedited. This case study will outline the steps taken to generate 20 unique Pixar-style animals in just 30 minutes.

## Initial Inspiration and Setup

The journey began in the Mid Journey Showcase, where I searched for an image style that resonated with me. Upon finding an appealing character design:

- **Prompt Copying**: Hovered over the image, clicked on the three dots, and selected "Copy Prompt" to capture the existing parameters that ensured a consistent artistic style.

## Customizing Prompts for Character Variations

The next step involved modifying the copied prompt to fit our specific needs, focusing on maintaining consistency while omitting any backgrounds to enhance character focus:

- **Prompt Modification**: Adjusted the original prompt to emphasize lighting, camera lens settings, and facial illumination, ensuring each character remained vibrant and expressive.

## Automation and Spreadsheet Integration

To automate the creation of multiple characters, I utilized Google Sheets alongside ChatGPT:

- **Character Traits Generation**: ChatGPT was employed to generate a diverse list of animals, which were then inputted into the spreadsheet.
- **Spreadsheet Setup**: Added columns for colors, animals, accessories, and prompts. Assigned random colors and used Excelâ€™s `CONCATENATE` function to merge these elements with parts of the base prompt.

## Efficient Image Generation

With the prompts ready, the process shifted back to Mid Journey:

- **Batch Processing**: Copied and pasted the prompts from Google Sheets into Mid Journey, generating a series of images based on the specified characteristics.

## Consistency and Further Automation

To ensure consistency and further automate the process:

- **Image Selection**: Filtered through the generated images to select those that matched the desired style closely.
- **Advanced Automation**: Uploaded the consistent images to Scenario JPG, creating a generator that could produce hundreds of variations based on the learned patterns.

## Conclusion

This case study not only demonstrates the power of combining Mid Journey with spreadsheet automation and advanced AI tools but also highlights the potential to rapidly produce a wide range of high-quality, creative outputs. By following these steps, artists and designers can harness AI to expand their creative horizons and efficiently generate extensive portfolios of unique, engaging content.
