### Neon Lights and Retro Wave Theme

- **Prompt Setup**: For a more vibrant transformation, use the prompt "neon lights, glow, and retro wave" after dragging in your photo.
- **Visualization**: The result is a dynamic portrait set against a backdrop of colorful, neon-lit scenes, enhancing the photo with a retro-futuristic vibe.

## Viewing and Sharing Your AI-Enhanced Portraits
