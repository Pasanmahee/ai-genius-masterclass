# Advanced Prompt Parameters: Mastering Aspect Ratios in Mid Journey

Understanding and applying advanced prompt parameters, such as aspect ratios, can significantly enhance the visual impact of your AI-generated art in Mid Journey. This guide will explore how to effectively use these parameters to create images that are not only beautiful but also perfectly suited for their intended use.

## The Importance of Aspect Ratios in Art Composition

Aspect ratios play a critical role in defining how an image is framed and perceived. In Mid Journey, you can manipulate aspect ratios to optimize your images for different platforms and purposes, from mobile screens to large-format prints.

### Common Aspect Ratios and Their Uses

- **9 by 16**: Ideal for mobile phone wallpapers or social media stories.
- **16 by 9**: Perfect for desktop wallpapers or digital screens.
- **3 by 2**: Commonly used for standard photography.
- **4 by 5**: Great for portrait posts on platforms like Instagram.

### How to Set Aspect Ratios in Mid Journey

To set an aspect ratio in Mid Journey, add the `--ar` parameter followed by the ratio you desire at the end of your prompt. For example:

```plaintext
--ar 16:9
```

This parameter instructs Mid Journey to generate the artwork in a 16:9 format, suitable for widescreen displays.

## Practical Application: Creating Themed Artworks

Letâ€™s explore how changing the aspect ratio can influence the style and composition of your artworks.

### Example 1: Portrait of an Owl

```plaintext
"Portrait of an owl with ornate jewelry around the eyes and ears, studio lighting, photorealistic --ar 9:16"
```

Objective: To create a detailed and intimate portrait suitable for vertical displays.

### Example 2: Spaceship in Space

```plaintext
"Spaceship flying through space with planets in the background --ar 16:9"
```

Objective: To capture a broad, cinematic landscape that showcases the spaceship and surrounding celestial bodies in a balanced composition.

## Experimenting with Different Aspect Ratios

To demonstrate the effect of aspect ratios, try generating the same subject with different ratios:

- **Vertical Orientation (9 by 16):** Focuses on height and is ideal for subjects like standing figures or tall structures.
- **Horizontal Orientation (16 by 9):** Expands the width, providing a panoramic view that is excellent for landscapes or scenes with multiple elements.

### Observing the Impact

When you switch from a vertical to a horizontal aspect ratio, notice how Mid Journey adjusts the composition to accommodate the format. This might mean zooming in for a close-up in a vertical frame or pulling back to include more of the scene in a horizontal frame.

## Conclusion

Mastering the use of aspect ratios in Mid Journey allows you to create more targeted and compositionally appropriate artworks. Whether you're aiming for dramatic portraits or expansive landscapes, adjusting the aspect ratio can dramatically improve the final output.
