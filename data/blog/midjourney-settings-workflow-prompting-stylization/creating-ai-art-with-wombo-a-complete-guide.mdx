# Exploring Wombo: A Free Alternative to Mid-journey for AI Art

Today, we dive into the exciting world of Wombo, an accessible and free AI art generator that allows you to create stunning and tantalizing images from abstract prompts. Let’s explore how you can harness Wombo to unleash your creativity.

## Getting Started with Wombo

Firstly, access Wombo by searching for "Wombo AI art generator" online, or directly visit [dreameye/create](https://dreameye.slash/create). The interface you’ll encounter is intuitive, making your artistic journey straightforward and enjoyable.

### Step 1: Initiating Your Art

- **Prompt Input**: Start by entering your prompt, but keep it within 350 characters to ensure clarity and focus.
- **Art Styles**: Wombo offers various art styles. Each style will influence the kind of image produced, so experiment with these to understand which align best with your artistic vision.

### Step 2: Advanced Features and Customization

- **Image Uploads**: Further down the menu, Wombo allows you to upload an image to use as a basis for your artwork. You can choose how strongly this image should influence the final output—options include 'strong', 'medium', or 'weak'.

### Step 3: Creating Your Art

- **Generation Process**: Click on ‘create’ to start the image generation. Wombo initially creates one image, but you can continue to prompt it to refine or alter the artwork.
- **Avoid Variations**: To avoid additional costs, do not click on 'make variations' unless necessary. Instead, re-run the creation process to iteratively refine the output.

## Practical Example: From Concept to Creation

Let’s put Wombo to the test with a creative prompt: envisioning a parkour scene running through a space station.

1. **Initial Creation**: Enter your prompt and select an art style. For instance, choosing 'super realistic' might give you a detailed portrayal of the space station.
2. **Iterative Refinement**: If the first result isn’t perfect, adjust your settings or prompt slightly and create again. This iterative process helps hone in on your desired outcome without extra costs.

## Tips for Using Wombo Effectively

- **Prompt Precision**: Place the most critical elements of your prompt at the beginning. This helps Wombo understand and prioritize important aspects of your request.
- **Art Style Exploration**: Each art style, from 'floral V2' to 'horror cut 2.1', offers unique interpretations. Explore these to find which best suits the theme or mood you’re aiming to capture.
- **Device Differences**: Note that using Wombo on a computer versus a phone can affect your experience and available features. For full functionality, as demonstrated here, use a computer.

## Conclusion

Wombo is a potent tool for creating AI-generated art, offering an enjoyable and free alternative for digital artists. Whether for professional use or personal exploration, Wombo provides a platform to transform imaginative prompts into vivid artworks. Dive in and explore the possibilities Wombo offers!

Remember, the key to mastering Wombo is experimentation. The more you use it, the better you’ll understand how to manipulate its features to serve your creative vision. Happy creating!
