# Mastering High-Quality Prompts for Professional AI Art in Mid Journey

In the world of AI-generated art, the quality of your prompts can significantly affect the visual outcome. By specifying certain quality-related keywords in your prompts, you can guide Mid Journey to produce images that not only capture your subject accurately but also emulate professional-level aesthetics.

## Understanding the Impact of Quality Keywords

Quality-related keywords like "4K", "HDR", and "hyper-realistic" play a crucial role in instructing Mid Journey on the type of images to reference when generating art. These terms are associated with high-resolution, high-dynamic range, and photorealism, which can drastically enhance the detail and realism of the generated images.

### The Role of High-Resolution Keywords

- **Example**: Creating an image of a "red car driving down the street."
- **Without Quality Keywords**: The output might lean towards a more animated or stylized interpretation.
- **With '4K' and 'HDR' Keywords**: Mid Journey pulls from high-resolution and HDR images, lending a more detailed and realistic quality to the artwork.

### Practical Example

Letâ€™s apply this knowledge:

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Red car driving down the street."
```

**Enhanced Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Red car driving down the street, 4K, HDR."
```

The enhanced prompt directs Mid Journey to utilize images that not only depict the subject but also match the high-quality aesthetics of modern photography, leading to outputs that are visually striking and detailed.

## Leveraging Professional Photography Keywords

Incorporating terms associated with professional achievements can also influence the artistic direction and quality of outputs:

- **Keywords like `award-winning` and `professional`:** These suggest a level of quality and framing that mimics renowned photography, potentially elevating the artistic standards of the AI-generated images.

## Example with Landscapes

**Simple Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Beautiful landscape with mountains and trees."
```

**Enhanced Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Beautiful landscape with mountains and trees, award-winning photography."
```

This prompt modification instructs Mid Journey to model its output on images that have been recognized for their excellence, thus likely improving aspects like composition, color balance, and overall impact.

## Conclusion

Using high-quality prompts in Mid Journey not only refines the visual output but also broadens the scope of what you can achieve with AI art generation. By understanding and applying these advanced prompting techniques, artists and creators can produce works that are not only unique but also comparable to professional standards.

In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into the nuances of using prompts effectively, ensuring that every creation you make stands out for its quality and creativity. Stay tuned for more insights and tips on mastering AI-generated art with Mid Journey.
