As we delve deeper into the capabilities of AI in art creation, it's essential to explore tools that can spark creativity and offer new ways to engage with AI. Today, I want to introduce you to two exceptional resources: PlaygroundAI and Lexica. Both platforms provide unique opportunities for inspiration, experimentation, and learning in the realm of AI-generated art.

## Lexica: Curating AI Art

[Lexica](https://lexica.art/) is another fantastic platform that curates AI art. It not only showcases the artwork but also provides detailed information about each piece, making it a great educational tool as well as a source of inspiration.

### Features of Lexica

- **Artwork Gallery**: View artworks created by others, with detailed prompts and settings used to generate each piece.
