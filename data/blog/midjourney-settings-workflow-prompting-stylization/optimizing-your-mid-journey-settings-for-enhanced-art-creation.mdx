# Adjusting Mid Journey Settings for Optimal AI Art Creation

Navigating the settings of Mid Journey within Discord is crucial for customizing the AI to better suit your artistic vision and usage habits. This guide will walk you through the process of accessing and adjusting these settings to enhance your experience and output quality.

## Accessing Settings in Discord

To begin adjusting your Mid Journey settings, simply type `/settings` in the Discord chat. This command opens a clickable panel that displays your current configuration, allowing for easy modifications.

### Key Settings to Consider

Here are some of the most impactful settings you can adjust in Mid Journey:

1. **Version**: Ensure you are using the latest version to take advantage of all features and improvements.
2. **Base Quality**: Toggle between different quality settings. Lower quality speeds up the creation process, while higher quality improves the detail and fidelity of the images but takes longer.
3. **Styling**: Adjust this setting based on how literally you want the AI to interpret your prompts. Set to low for more literal interpretations and high for more artistic flair.
4. **Upscaling**: Choose your preferred upscaling style. This affects the resolution and clarity of the final output.
5. **Visibility Mode**: Switch between public and stealth modes depending on whether you want your creations to be visible to others in the community.
6. **Remix Mode**: Enable or disable the ability to remix images, which affects how you can interact with and alter existing images.
7. **Fast Mode**: Manage how quickly you want the AI to generate images. Fast mode uses credits but delivers results quicker, while relaxed mode conserves your credits and produces images more slowly.

### Practical Application

Let's apply these settings adjustments with a hypothetical prompt:

```plaintext
Prompt: "Sunset over the ocean with a silhouette of a sailing boat."
Settings: Quality set to high, styling on medium, upscaling at 2x, public mode.
```

By setting the quality high, the AI will generate a more detailed and visually appealing image of the sunset, though it may take longer. The medium styling ensures a balance between artistic interpretation and literal accuracy.

## Managing Usage Credits

It's important to be aware of your usage credits, especially when using fast mode. Each billing cycle provides a certain amount of fast mode hours. If you're working on a project that requires quick outputs, use these wisely. For projects where time is less critical, using relaxed mode can help conserve your credits.

## Conclusion

Understanding and tweaking your Mid Journey settings can significantly enhance your ability to create stunning AI-generated art tailored to your specific needs and preferences. By mastering these settings, you ensure that every project aligns more closely with your creative vision, whether you're aiming for rapid prototyping or high-quality art productions.

In the next session, we'll delve deeper into specific scenarios and examples of how changing different settings can affect the artistic outcomes of your projects. Stay tuned for more expert tips and tricks!
