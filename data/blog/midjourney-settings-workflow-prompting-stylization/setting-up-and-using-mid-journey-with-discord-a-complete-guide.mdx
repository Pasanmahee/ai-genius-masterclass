# Introduction to Mid Journey and Discord for Digital Art

In this lesson, we'll not only dive into the creative aspects of digital art creation using Mid Journey, but also guide you through the essential setup steps for using Mid Journey and Discord effectively. 

## Step 1: Joining Mid Journey and Creating Your Account

To begin, navigate to [Mid Journey's website](https://midjourney.com/home/) and click on "Join" to start the sign-up process. Here’s how you can create your Mid Journey account:
- Choose your username and continue.
- Verify that you are human and input your birthdate.
- Provide your email address and proceed to download the desktop app for the next steps.

## Step 2: Setting Up Discord for Art Creation

Once you've initiated the download for the Discord desktop app, install it by double-clicking the DMG file and opening the application on your computer. Discord is also available for mobile devices; download it from your app store to stay connected on the go.

### Navigating Discord
- Upon launching Discord, you'll see various servers on the left bar. We'll cover how to create your own server shortly.
- Explore the channels within these servers—each contains sections for specific information such as announcements, rules, and polls.

### Interacting with the Community
- Discord is vital for inspiration and seeing others' creative processes. Remember, anything you post is public within community servers, so consider creating a private server for personal projects.

## Step 3: Creating Your Own Server

To start your own server:
- Click "Add Server" and select "Create My Own".
- Name your server (e.g., "My New Server") and create it.

## Step 4: Integrating Mid Journey Bot into Your Server

- Go back to the Mid Journey server and find the Mid Journey bot.
- Click on the bot's username, select "Add to Server", choose your newly created server, and authorize the bot.

## Step 5: Starting Your Artwork with Mid Journey

Before creating any artwork, always use the `/imagine` command in Discord. This tells Mid Journey what you want to turn into art:
- Type `/imagine` followed by your creative prompt.
- Ensure to start your commands with `/imagine` whether you're using the desktop or mobile app.
