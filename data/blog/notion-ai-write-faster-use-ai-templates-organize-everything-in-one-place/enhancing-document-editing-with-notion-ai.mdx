# Enhancing Document Editing with Notion AI

In this lesson, we dive deep into how you can use Notion AI to generate, edit, and review written content, transforming your workflow and boosting productivity.

## Overview

We start with a pre-written documentâ€”a detailed proposal for a three-day workshop. The original text is crafted manually, without AI assistance, providing a base for us to explore Notion AI's capabilities.

## Methods to Engage Notion AI

There are two primary ways to utilize Notion AI for editing your document:

1. **Blank Space Prompting**:
   - Click on an empty area and press `space` to invoke AI options for the entire document.
   - This method is useful for broad modifications like translating the entire document.

2. **Specific Text Highlighting**:
   - Highlight the text you want to modify and click `Ask AI`.
   - This approach allows for targeted editing, such as improving or translating specific paragraphs.

### Practical Examples

- **Translating the Document**:
   - By selecting the entire document and choosing to translate it into German, Notion AI provides a complete translation, adapting every part of the text.

- **Refining Specific Text**:
   - Highlighting the introductory paragraph and selecting 'Improve Writing' enhances the clarity and punctuation without a complete rewrite.

### Interactive Features After Translation

Notion AI offers several post-translation options to integrate or adjust the AI-generated text:

- **Replace Selection**: Overwrites the original text with the AI's version.
- **Insert Below**: Places the new text beneath the highlighted section, preserving both versions.
- **Continue Writing**: Extends the document based on its last section.
- **Make Longer/Shorter**: Expands or condenses the selected text.
- **Discard or Try Again**: Either discard the changes or attempt a retranslation.

### Advanced Editing Tools

- **Fixing Spelling and Grammar**:
   - This standard tool corrects spelling and grammar errors, similar to other word processing software, but integrated within Notion for convenience.

- **Adjusting Text Length**:
   - Making text shorter or longer based on specific needs, such as word count requirements for submissions or publications.

## Conclusion

Notion AI significantly enhances the editing process, providing sophisticated tools to refine your writing. Whether you're adjusting a few paragraphs or overhauling an entire document, Notion AI integrates seamlessly into your workflow, making document management more efficient and effective.
